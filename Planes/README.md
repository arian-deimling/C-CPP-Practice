<p>This program demonstrates the creation of child processes using C Standard library function 
Using a simple command line interface, the user of the program can
launch planes (child processes), and send signals from the parent
process to make the planes refuel or bomb. The child processes 
gradually consume fuel and are terminated once their fuel level
drops to zero. The command line interface also allows the user to
retrieve a list of live child process IDs or quit the parent and 
all child processes. Type `help` for a list of commands or `q` to 
quit.
